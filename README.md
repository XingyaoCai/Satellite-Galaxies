# Satellite-Galaxies
The Milky Way, as the galaxy we live in, is also currently the one we know the most about, and there are still many phenomena in it that currently remain unknown. One of them is the formation and evolution of massive satellite galaxies, which we hope to study in this project. Both the Milky Way and Andromeda have massive satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Triangulum Galaxy. Current observations show that both of these galaxies are in their first infall. We use the IllustrisTNG database to search for this eigenstructure in an attempt to give a theoretical formation explanation.
